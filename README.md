# Hi, I’m Varun Rodrigues

I’m a freshman at Caltech, where I’m exploring working at the intersection of machine learning and biochemistry. I enjoy building technical solutions for academic problems and practical solutions for real-world ones. 

## Interests  
- Machine learning and computational biochemistry  
- Full-stack development
- Diffusion models

## Projects
**Founder and Creator — [CurveGenius.com](https://curvegenius.com)**  
Designed and launched a platform that helps teachers apply fair grading curves to exams. Built the site from scratch and continue to maintain it based on user feedback.  

**Creator - [Caltech Course Code Tooltip](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/caltech-course-code-toolt/poclaoemooaflhchilgkmbknkfpfdije)**
Build a Chrome extension that allows users that automatically detects Caltech course codes on web pages and displays helpful tooltips.

## Outside of STEM  
When I’m not working on research or coding, I compose and perform piano music—some of my compositions have won awards. I also run cross-country and track at the Division III level for Caltech. I enjoy traveling, meeting new people, and learning from different perspectives.
